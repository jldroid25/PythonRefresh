-------- Using Beautifull Soup library to parse HTML -----------
>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org')

>>> html = response.test

>>> print(html)

# Use the BeautifulSoup to parse the html
>>> soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

>>> soup.title # get the page title

>>> soup.p  # get a paragraph

>>> soup.p.a # get a link in a paragraph

>>> for link in soup.find_all('a') #Get all the links in paragraph
         print(link.get('href'))

-------------------The Sequence of Steps
We've determined that our program will be structured in a while loop. Earlier on we establish the steps that need to go in the loop

1 - Find the first link in the current article's HTML
2 - Download the HTML for the current article
3 - Add the first link from the current article to article_chain
  There's one other step we didn't explicitly state earlier:

4 - Pause for a couple seconds so we don't flood Wikipedia with requests.

------------Psaudocode ----------------
page = a random starting page
article_chain = []
while title of page isn't 'Philosophy' and we have not discovered a cycle:
    append page to article_chain
    download the page content
    find the first link in the content
    page = that link
    pause for a second
