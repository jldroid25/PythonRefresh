''' ------ Working with Integers and Floats in Python -----


There are two Python data types that could be used for numeric values:

- int - for integer values

- float - for decimal or floating point values

You can create a value that follows 
the data type by using the following syntax:

'''

x = int(4.7) # x is now an integer of 4
y = float(4) # y is now a float of 4.0

print(x)
print(type(x))

print(y)
print(type(y))

''' 
In general, there are two types of errors to look out for

Exceptions
Syntax
An Exception: is a problem that occurs when the code is running, 
but a 'Syntax Error' is a problem detected when Python checks 
the code before it runs it.
